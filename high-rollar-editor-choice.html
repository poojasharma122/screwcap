                                        Walkable to the casino but distinctly its own world. With spa suites, calm
                                        interiors, and a
                                        focus on wellness touches, this boutique stay is ideal for travellers who want
                                        to play the
                                        tables — then fully reset. It’s also near some of the city’s best late-night
                                        dining.

                                        Why it works: It pairs gaming proximity with complete relaxation. You don’t feel
                                        like you’re
                                        sleeping inside a casino — just next to one.

                                        alpine-lux with a tucked-away feel — plus you’re steps from bars, the lake, and
                                        blackjack.

                                        It’s clean, central, and consistent — and the casino’s a short
                                        walk, not a

                                        bed, and a solid layout often beat staying directly above the slots.

                                        It balances minimalism with depth — both in design and wine. Understated
                                        excellence, well
                                        off the radar.

                                        A modern, sculptural tasting room built into the land, Te Kano doesn’t chase
                                        foot traffic. It
                                        invites stillness. The wines are expressive and the outlook across the valley is
                                        one of the
                                        best in the region.

                                        advertised — but they stick with you. They remind you why New Zealand cellar

                                        works: because it’s about place, not polish.
