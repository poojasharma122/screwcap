                                        New Zealand’s wine regions aren’t just about what’s in the glass — they shape
                                        the pace,
                                        atmosphere, and architecture of the places you stay. Here’s a guide to the six
                                        regions that do
                                        it best, and what makes each one worth building a trip around.

                                        New Zealand’s most famous wine region is also its most open and sun-filled.

                                        vineyard-lined country drives, coastal detours, and cellar doors where the

                                        still pour the glass. It’s also one of the easiest regions to stay among the
                                        vines, with boutique
                                        cottages and vineyard lodges dotted across the Wairau and Awatere Valleys.

                                        Queenstown offers high-end comfort just a short drive away. Here, a vineyard

                                        scenic — it often includes mountain views from the bed.

                                        and tasting rooms are often perched on hillsides with sea views. Stay in a

                                        Cable Bay offers sleek interiors and strong wine — and their guesthouse matches
                                        the tone.
                                        Perched above the vines with modern architecture and open-plan spaces, it’s
                                        perfect for
                                        travellers who want something refined but relaxed. Walk to the beach, the cellar
                                        door, or stay
                                        in and enjoy the view.

                                        Most Waiheke visitors take the last ferry back. Staying lets you skip the rush,
                                        slow the pace,
                                        and actually take in the island’s energy after the crowds leave. With good wine,
                                        good views,
                                        and no need to drive — it’s the right way to do it.

                                        How the Screwcap Changed New Zealand Wine (and Travel)
                                    </h2>
                                    <p>
                                        In the early 2000s, a group of New Zealand winemakers made a decision that would
                                        reshape the industry: they swapped the cork for the screwcap.
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                                <div class="hot_exp_content" style="display: none;">
                                    <p>
                                        What seemed simple at the time turned out to be a bold statement. It said: we
                                        back the
                                        quality of what’s in the bottle — and we’re not waiting for permission. It cut
                                        out pretence,
                                        improved reliability, and signalled to the world that New Zealand wine was
                                        serious about
                                        doing things differently.
                                    </p>

                                        So why name a travel site after it?
                                    </h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Because the same idea applies to travel.
                                    </p>

                                        Screwcap as a name is about clarity over clutter. It's about skipping the
                                        elaborate and
                                        focusing on what works — sharp stays, good settings, and a strong sense of what
                                        you're
                                        getting. Just like the screwcap changed how people trusted a bottle of wine, we
                                        think the
                                        same can be done for finding the right place to stay.
